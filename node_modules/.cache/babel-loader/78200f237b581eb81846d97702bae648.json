My name is Arshdeep and I am currently a 3rd-year computer science student at Wilfred Laurier. My interests lie in the intersection of computer science and business. I love to complete projects because the knowledge I gain and the lessons I learn during the process are essential to my learning and growth. I am currently looking for opportunities to leverage my interests and expand my skill sets in the fields of business, web/app development, and Object-Oriented Design. My goal is to make a difference; I strive to use my abilities in order to devise a better society for the future generations and I am constantly seeking out new experiences that will assist me in meeting this objective. \")));\n}\n\nexport default About;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/Arshdeep/Desktop/arshdeepgrewal/aap/src/Pages/About.js"],"names":["React","Hero","Content","About","props","title"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,IAAP,MAAiB,oBAAjB;AAEA,OAAOC,OAAP,MAAoB,uBAApB;;AAGA,SAASC,KAAT,CAAeC,KAAf,EAAqB;AACjB,SACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,oBAAC,IAAD;AAAM,IAAA,KAAK,EAAEA,KAAK,CAACC,KAAnB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,EAGI,oBAAC,OAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,2uBADJ,CAHJ,CADJ;AAWH;;AAED,eAAeF,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport Hero from '../Components/Hero'\n\nimport Content from '../Components/Content'\n\n\nfunction About(props){\n    return(\n        <div>\n            <Hero title={props.title} />\n\n            <Content>\n                <p>Hi there, thank you for visiting my website!
